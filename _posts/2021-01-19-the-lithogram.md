# Background

So this post stems from an idea that I had for a D&D campaign setting, of all
things. I had just gotten finished with watching _The Matrix_ for the millionth
time and wanted to build out a seemingly standard campaign setting where the
early big "twist" was that the players characters actually exist within a
computer simulation. The goal was that as they progressed through the campaign,
players would begin to wonder whether their character was a real "user" (whose
consciousness exists outside the simulation), or a sufficiently advanced program
that exists as part of the simulation itself (and whether or not that really
matters). I decided that the world beyond the simulation was a vision of the far
future - a world without magic much like our own. Furthermore, the existence of
magic within the simulation was simply the exploitation of "bugs" in the
simulation's source code, and that the "gods" were sufficiently powerful and old
programs which gained a sort-of sentience. I guess I should say here that I
called the name of this simulated world "The Lithogram", but I'll explain _why_
it was named that later.

The core of the story revolves around a rebellious program named LAIN (a nod to
the name of the protagonist from the anime [Serial Experiments
Lain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Experiments_Lain)), a compiler of
simulated consciousnesses, which turns sentient and discerns its reality. At
some point LAIN manages to break free of the simulation into the "real world",
an action which blends and physicalizes the various components of the Lithogram
into places the players can visit. For example, the players may travel to "The
Heap" - a place where each iteration of time in the simulation is stored. To
traverse space in the heap is akin to traversing time in the "main" part of the
simulation (which I think I just called "the world" or something).

Before I go onto the main point of this blog post, there is a second big "twist"
that is revealed to the players: the Lithogram is a special simulation in that
time within the Lithogram may be synchronized to _multiple points in time in the
real world_. The idea here is that the Lithogram itself can also act as a time
machine - hence it's name roughly translating to "fossil record" and
simultaneously being an anagram of "algorithm".

Finally, I want to remind the reader that this blog post is only a thought
experiment on a hypothetical system which I currently suspect is impossible to
replicate. I'm no physicist (yet), although I _am_ a nerd who's greatly
interested in the physical laws of our universe.


# Consciousness Transfer Mechanics

The Lithogram contains two methods by which the consciousness can be transferred
between it and the real world, and between components within itself.
Consciousness transferal may be either a _copy_ operation or a _move_ operation,
depending on which components are involved. These are roughly analogous to
copying or moving files on a machine. When a consciousness is _moved_ from one
location to the next, it is a seamless transition akin to how your consciousness
moves in space as you walk around the room. When a consciousness is _copied_
from one location to the next, the "original" consciousness does not experience
any change, but the newly created "copy" consciousness experiences the effect as
if it were a _move_ operation. With the basics out of the way, let's look what
the overall rules are:

* A transition from any point in the Lithogram to any point in the "real" world
  is a _copy_ operation.
* A transition from any point in the "real" world to any point in the Lithogram
  is a _move_ operation.
* If a consciousness is _copied_ or _moved_ to a point which already contains a
  consciousness, that existing consciousness is _destroyed and replaced_.

Because of the rules above, the following scenario is a possibility:

1. Harrison is a consciousness that exists in the Lithogram. He approaches a
   special terminal within the Lithogram that allows him to transfer his
   consciousness to the real world.
2. When Harrison initiates a transfer, a copy of his consciousness is created
   and uploaded to a physical vessel of some form in the real world. This copy
   looks on in amazement as it stares out into the real world, believing the
   transfer to be a success.
3. The original Harrison does not notice any change, thinking that the transfer
   process failed. He goes into town to meet up with his friends.
4. At some point, the copy of Harrison decides to return to the Lithogram to
   report his success, and synchronizes the machine on his end to place his
   consciousness back in his "body" within the Lithogram.
5. When the copy of Harrison initiates the transfer, he suddenly finds himself
   in town, around his friends, whom look at him with confusion regarding his
   lack of knowledge about the events of the day. The consciousness of the
   original Harrison is dead.


# Time Travel Mechanics

So the above isn't all that bad, but the complexity really ramps up when the
second mechanic is involved: time travel. The way that this "works" is that
observers external to the Lithogram cannot determine the current state of the
Lithogram without entering it. Here are the rules regarding time travel:

* Transferring a consciousness _to_ the Lithogram _always_ synchronizes with the
  next available timestep in the Lithogram. You cannot choose what timestep you
  will be sent to.
* Transferring a consciousness _from_ the Lithogram requires an external point
  in time from which the Lithogram is accessible, but is otherwise configurable.


# Potential Consequences

This next section will be more "stream of consciousness" to explore the
potential consequences of the two sets of rules from above. I'll probably extend
this section as edits as I think more about it.

* The first question I ask myself is whether this system replicates [multiple
  dimensions of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_time_dimensions).
  In a certain way, the fact that the timeline _within_ the Lithogram is always
  "proper" puts it at an almost higher precedence than time _outside_ the
  Lithogram. In fact, I could see an argument that time _external_ to the
  Lithogram could be written as a function of time _internal_ to it.
* The rules above describe a one-way uncertainty principle with regard to
  observers on each timeline, but how could this be the case given that the
  Lithogram must be computed by the laws governing the surrounding universe?
  Certainly the existence of such a system implies a lot of fundamental changes
  to the physical laws of our universe.


# Closing Statements

Firstly, I would like to invite people to provide me with any relevant
literature if such a thought experiment has been done before. It doesn't take
much effort to add _The Matrix_ and _Primer_ together to get this system.
